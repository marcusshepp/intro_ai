My GA sometimes only needs one generation to find a solution. But to be confident I set it to two hunderd.

I chose a population size of 50 because it was the max aloud. Also, the larger the population size the faster my GA finds a solution.

At first I had a mutation rate of 0.5. But after trial and error I found that a mutation rate of 1 (always mutate) gives me a solution is less generations. So, I went with the latter.
